# Data Structures and Algorithms

A repository I am making to implement common algorithms and data structures from scratch.

## Binary Search
- Searches through an array by halving the size of the array on each iteration
- Input: Array of size $n$
- Output: Index of found element $x$, or None
- Runtime: $O(\log n)$
